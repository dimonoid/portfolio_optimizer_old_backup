# portfolio_optimizer_old_backup
My old project from 2021 and was modified multiple times. Attempts to find optimal portfolio out of a list of tickers by maximizing growth and minimizing volatility. This is backup, further updates are not expected since current strategy appeared not effective (overfits too easily).
